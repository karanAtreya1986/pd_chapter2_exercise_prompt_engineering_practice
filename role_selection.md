# Specialized Testing Roles & Responsibilities

### 1. Accessibility Specialist
**Task:** Generate WCAG compliance tests
**Focus:** Ensuring the application meets Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1/2.2). This includes screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation, color contrast, and ARIA label verification.

### 2. Security Tester
**Task:** Create SQL injection test cases
**Focus:** Identifying vulnerabilities where malicious SQL statements can be inserted into entry fields for execution. This involves testing parameterized queries, input sanitization, and database error leakage.

### 3. Performance Engineer
**Task:** Design load test scenarios
**Focus:** Defining system behavior under heavy load. This includes determining concurrent user thresholds, response time baselines, resource utilization (CPU/Memory), and identifying stability bottlenecks.

### 4. Test Automation Architect
**Task:** Review test code for flakiness
**Focus:** Analyzing automated test suites to identify non-deterministic failures. This involves reviewing synchronization issues (waits), environment dependencies, test data management, and code design patterns like Page Object Model.

### 5. API Testing Specialist / Senior QA Engineer
**Task:** Write API contract tests
**Focus:** Ensuring the API provider and consumer adhere to a shared specification (Consumer Driven Contract Testing). This validates that schema changes do not break downstream integrations.
